# 🚀Web App Deployment via Terraform, Docker & Jenkins

This project demonstrates a complete Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pipeline to provision cloud infrastructure and automate deployment of a web application using **Terraform**, **Docker Swarm**, **Ansible**, and **Jenkins**.

---

## 📦 Features

### ✅ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- All AWS resources are provisioned using **Terraform**.
- Enables **repeatable**, **predictable**, and **automated** infrastructure deployments.

### 🐳 Container Orchestration
- Docker images are built using **Dockerfiles**.
- **Docker Swarm** is used for orchestrating containers across nodes for **scalability** and **fault tolerance**.

### ⚙️ Configuration Management
- Server configuration is automated via **Ansible Playbooks**.
- Uses **Ansible roles** for modular playbooks and **Ansible Vault** for secure storage of secrets.
- Shell scripts are used for automating manual deployment tasks.

### 🔐 Security
- Resources are launched in a **custom VPC** with specific **subnets**, **network interfaces**, **security groups**, and **private IPs**.
- Secure handling of access credentials and traffic control.

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
- **Jenkins** is used to automate the deployment of the web application.
- Manages credentials securely and reduces deployment time.

### 🔧 Web App Deployment
- You can deploy **any web application** by simply modifying the `Dockerfile` according to your app's requirements and also changing same in Jenkinsfile.

---

## 📁 Terraform Modules

- **`master_template`**: Provisions the **master server** along with its VPC, subnet, and security groups. Configuration is bootstrapped via **cloud-init**.
- **`node_template`**: Provisions **worker nodes** that join the Docker Swarm cluster (You can increase the no of nodes needed as per your need by modifying this template but also take care to add and modify the variables also)

## Terraform variables

## 📥 Terraform Variables

| Variable            | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `region`            | Region where your instance will be deployed     |
| `vpc-cidr`          | CIDR block for the VPC                          |
| `subnet-cidr`       | CIDR block for the subnet                       |
| `ami`               | AMI ID to launch the EC2 instance               |
| `instance-type`     | EC2 instance type (e.g., t2.micro)              |
| `key`               | Key pair name to access the instance            |
| `role`              | IAM role name (should allow EC2 access)         |
| `private-ip`        | Private IP of the node instance                 |
| `master-private-ip` | Private IP of the master instance               |

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

Note: Ensure that if you are using a windows machine, you would need to install a WSL and install git,ansible and terraform in it since ansible-vault can be edit using a linux os.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rocinate-droid/Devops-Project.git
cd Devops-Project

## 2. AWS Credentials & Key Setup

- Generate **Access Key** and **Secret Key** from your AWS account.
- Create an **IAM Role** with EC2 access.
- Generate an **EC2 key pair**  
  *(Take care to change the IAM role and EC2 key pair in the terraform variables.)*

---

### 3. Export AWS Credentials

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
```

---

### 4. Deploy the Master Server

- Go to the master template folder and execute the following command:
```bash
cd master_template/
bash create.sh
```

---

### 6. Set Up SSH Key for Nodes

Inside the master instance:

```bash
sudo -u jenkins -i
ssh-keygen
```

- Copy the **public key** from .pub file and paste it into the `user_data` section in the `node_template.tf` Terraform file.

---

### 7. Initialize Docker Swarm

Inside the master instance:

```bash
sudo docker swarm init
```

- Copy the **join token** displayed in the terminal.

---

### 8. Store Swarm Token Securely

```bash
cd resume-role/vars
ansible-vault edit main.yml
```

> 💡 Password: `devops`  
> Paste the **Docker Swarm join token** inside the `main.yml` file.

---

### 9. Jenkins Setup

- Visit Jenkins at:

```
http://<master-public-ip>:8080
```

- Add a Jenkins **credential** as secret text for accessing ansible vault(swarm token):

  - **ID**: `vault_password`  
  - **Secret Text**: `devops`

---

### 10. Setup Pipeline

- Push your files to a **GitHub repository**.
- Create a **Pipeline Job** in Jenkins and change the git credentials in the Jenkins file before the build.
- Trigger the pipeline to deploy the application.

---

### 11. Access Your Web Application

Visit your deployed web application(uses nginx service):

```
http://<master-public-ip>:80
http://<node-public-ip>:80
```
